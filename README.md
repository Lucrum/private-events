# private-events

This project is from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events).

A Rails based event management site, allowing users to create events and manage user sign ups. It is an exercise on ActiveRecord associations, and managing increasingly complex relationships between users and events.

# usage

Navigate into the folder and run `bundle install` to install necessary gems.

To start the server, run `bin/rails s`.

Guests may view a list of all upcoming and past events, as well as sign up for an account.

Logged in users may also create, edit, and join events as they please.
